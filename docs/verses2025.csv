1 Corinthians~1~1~Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes,
1 Corinthians~1~2~To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:
1 Corinthians~1~3~Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians~1~4~I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus, 
1 Corinthians~1~5~that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge— 
1 Corinthians~1~6~even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you— 
1 Corinthians~1~7~so that you are not lacking in any gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1 Corinthians~1~8~who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1 Corinthians~1~9~God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
1 Corinthians~1~10~I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment. 
1 Corinthians~1~11~For it has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there is quarreling among you, my brothers. 
1 Corinthians~1~12~What I mean is that each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.” 
1 Corinthians~1~13~Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? 
1 Corinthians~1~14~I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, 
1 Corinthians~1~15~so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name. 
1 Corinthians~1~16~(I did baptize also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.) 
1 Corinthians~1~17~For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
1 Corinthians~1~18~For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 
1 Corinthians~1~19~For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.”
1 Corinthians~1~20~Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 
1 Corinthians~1~21~For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. 
1 Corinthians~1~22~For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, 
1 Corinthians~1~23~but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, 
1 Corinthians~1~24~but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 
1 Corinthians~1~25~For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
1 Corinthians~1~26~For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. 
1 Corinthians~1~27~But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;
1 Corinthians~1~28~God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, 
1 Corinthians~1~29~so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. 
1 Corinthians~1~30~And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, 
1 Corinthians~1~31~so that, as it is written, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”
1 Corinthians~2~1~And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom. 
1 Corinthians~2~2~For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. 
1 Corinthians~2~3~And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling, 
1 Corinthians~2~4~and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 
1 Corinthians~2~5~so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.
1 Corinthians~2~6~Yet among the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to pass away. 
1 Corinthians~2~7~But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glory. 
1 Corinthians~2~8~None of the rulers of this age understood this, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 
1 Corinthians~2~9~But, as it is written, “What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him”—
1 Corinthians~2~10~these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. 
1 Corinthians~2~11~For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 
1 Corinthians~2~12~Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. 
1 Corinthians~2~13~And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.
1 Corinthians~2~14~The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. 
1 Corinthians~2~15~The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. 
1 Corinthians~2~16~“For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.
1 Corinthians~3~1~But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. 
1 Corinthians~3~2~I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready, 
1 Corinthians~3~3~for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way? 
1 Corinthians~3~4~For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not being merely human?
1 Corinthians~3~5~What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each. 
1 Corinthians~3~6~I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. 
1 Corinthians~3~7~So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. 
1 Corinthians~3~8~He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor. 
1 Corinthians~3~9~For we are God's fellow workers. You are God's field, God's building.
1 Corinthians~3~10~According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds upon it. 
1 Corinthians~3~11~For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
1 Corinthians~3~12~Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw— 
1 Corinthians~3~13~each one's work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. 
1 Corinthians~3~14~If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. 
1 Corinthians~3~15~If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.
1 Corinthians~3~16~Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you? 
1 Corinthians~3~17 If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple.
1 Corinthians~3~18~Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. 
1 Corinthians~3~19~For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, “He catches the wise in their craftiness,” 
1 Corinthians~3~20~and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.” 
1 Corinthians~3~21~So let no one boast in men. For all things are yours, 
1 Corinthians~3~22~whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours, 
1 Corinthians~3~23~and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
1 Corinthians~4~1~This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. 
1 Corinthians~4~2~Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful. 
1 Corinthians~4~3~But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. 
1 Corinthians~4~4~For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me. 
1 Corinthians~4~5~Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his commendation from God.
1 Corinthians~4~6~I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, brothers, that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another. 
1 Corinthians~4~7~For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?
1 Corinthians~4~8~Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! Without us you have become kings! And would that you did reign, so that we might share the rule with you! 
1 Corinthians~4~9~For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. 
1 Corinthians~4~10~We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. 
1 Corinthians~4~11~To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless, 
1 Corinthians~4~12~and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; 
1 Corinthians~4~13~when slandered, we entreat. We have become, and are still, like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things.
1 Corinthians~4~14~I do not write these things to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children. 
1 Corinthians~4~15~For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. 
1 Corinthians~4~16~I urge you, then, be imitators of me. 
1 Corinthians~4~17~That is why I sent you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, to remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach them everywhere in every church. 
1 Corinthians~4~18~Some are arrogant, as though I were not coming to you. 
1 Corinthians~4~19~But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power. 
1 Corinthians~4~20~For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power. 
1 Corinthians~4~21~What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love in a spirit of gentleness?
1 Corinthians~5~1~It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father's wife. 
1 Corinthians~5~2~And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you.
1 Corinthians~5~3~For though absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present, I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing. 
1 Corinthians~5~4~When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 
1 Corinthians~5~5~you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.
1 Corinthians~5~6~Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? 
1 Corinthians~5~7~Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. 
1 Corinthians~5~8~Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
1 Corinthians~5~9~I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— 
1 Corinthians~5~10~not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world. 
1 Corinthians~5~11~But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with such a one. 
1 Corinthians~5~12~For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? 
1 Corinthians~5~13~God judges those outside. “Purge the evil person from among you.”
1 Corinthians~6~1~When one of you has a grievance against another, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of the saints? 
1 Corinthians~6~2~Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases? 
1 Corinthians~6~3~Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, then, matters pertaining to this life! 
1 Corinthians~6~4~So if you have such cases, why do you lay them before those who have no standing in the church? 
1 Corinthians~6~5~I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers, 
1 Corinthians~6~6~but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers? 
1 Corinthians~6~7~To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded? 
1 Corinthians~6~8~But you yourselves wrong and defraud—even your own brothers!
1 Corinthians~6~9~Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, 
1 Corinthians~6~10~nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 
1 Corinthians~6~11~And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
1 Corinthians~6~12~“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be dominated by anything. 
1 Corinthians~6~13~“Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food”—and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. 
1 Corinthians~6~14~And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power. 
1 Corinthians~6~15~Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! 
1 Corinthians~6~16~Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, “The two will become one flesh.” 
1 Corinthians~6~17~But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him. 
1 Corinthians~6~18~Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. 
1 Corinthians~6~19~Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, 
1 Corinthians~6~20~for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.
1 Corinthians~7~1~Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.” 
1 Corinthians~7~2~But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. 
1 Corinthians~7~3~The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. 
1 Corinthians~7~4~For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. 
1 Corinthians~7~5~Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
1 Corinthians~7~6~Now as a concession, not a command, I say this. 
1 Corinthians~7~7~I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own gift from God, one of one kind and one of another.
1 Corinthians~7~8~To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. 
1 Corinthians~7~9~But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
1 Corinthians~7~10~To the married I give this charge (not I, but the Lord): the wife should not separate from her husband 
1 Corinthians~7~11~(but if she does, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and the husband should not divorce his wife.
1 Corinthians~7~12~To the rest I say (I, not the Lord) that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her. 
1 Corinthians~7~13~If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him. 
1 Corinthians~7~14~For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. 
1 Corinthians~7~15~But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to peace. 
1 Corinthians~7~16~For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?
1 Corinthians~7~17~Only let each person lead the life that the Lord has assigned to him, and to which God has called him. This is my rule in all the churches. 
1 Corinthians~7~18~Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision. 
1 Corinthians~7~19~For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God. 
1 Corinthians~7~20~Each one should remain in the condition in which he was called. 
1 Corinthians~7~21~Were you a bondservant when called? Do not be concerned about it. (But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.) 
1 Corinthians~7~22~For he who was called in the Lord as a bondservant is a freedman of the Lord. Likewise he who was free when called is a bondservant of Christ. 
1 Corinthians~7~23~You were bought with a price; do not become bondservants of men. 
1 Corinthians~7~24~So, brothers, in whatever condition each was called, there let him remain with God.
1 Corinthians~7~25~Now concerning the betrothed, I have no command from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. 
1 Corinthians~7~26~I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is. 
1 Corinthians~7~27~Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. 
1 Corinthians~7~28~But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that. 
1 Corinthians~7~29~This is what I mean, brothers: the appointed time has grown very short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none, 
1 Corinthians~7~30~and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods, 
1 Corinthians~7~31~and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.
1 Corinthians~7~32~I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. 
1 Corinthians~7~33~But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife, 
1 Corinthians~7~34~and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband. 
1 Corinthians~7~35~I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.
1 Corinthians~7~36~If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed, if his passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry—it is no sin. 
1 Corinthians~7~37~But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well. 
1 Corinthians~7~38~So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.
1 Corinthians~7~39~A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord. 
1 Corinthians~7~40~Yet in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is. And I think that I too have the Spirit of God.
1 Corinthians~8~1~Now concerning food offered to idols: we know that “all of us possess knowledge.” This “knowledge” puffs up, but love builds up. 
1 Corinthians~8~2~If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know. 
1 Corinthians~8~3~But if anyone loves God, he is known by God.
1 Corinthians~8~4~Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that “an idol has no real existence,” and that “there is no God but one.” 
1 Corinthians~8~5~For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”— 
1 Corinthians~8~6~yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.
1 Corinthians~8~7~However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, through former association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 
1 Corinthians~8~8~Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.
1 Corinthians~8~9~But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. 
1 Corinthians~8~10~For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol's temple, will he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols? 
1 Corinthians~8~11~And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died. 
1 Corinthians~8~12~Thus, sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. 
1 Corinthians~8~13~Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.
1 Corinthians~9~1~Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not you my workmanship in the Lord? 
1 Corinthians~9~2~If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you, for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
1 Corinthians~9~3~This is my defense to those who would examine me. 
1 Corinthians~9~4~Do we not have the right to eat and drink? 
1 Corinthians~9~5~Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? 
1 Corinthians~9~6~Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living? 
1 Corinthians~9~7~Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit? Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk?
1 Corinthians~9~8~Do I say these things on human authority? Does not the Law say the same? 
1 Corinthians~9~9~For it is written in the Law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain.” Is it for oxen that God is concerned? 
1 Corinthians~9~10~Does he not certainly speak for our sake? It was written for our sake, because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of sharing in the crop. 
1 Corinthians~9~11~If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things from you? 
1 Corinthians~9~12~If others share this rightful claim on you, do not we even more? Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right, but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.
1 Corinthians~9~13~Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings? 
1 Corinthians~9~14~In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.
1 Corinthians~9~15~But I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing these things to secure any such provision. For I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my ground for boasting. 
1 Corinthians~9~16~For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! 
1 Corinthians~9~17~For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward, but if not of my own will, I am still entrusted with a stewardship. 
1 Corinthians~9~18~What then is my reward? That in my preaching I may present the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.
1 Corinthians~9~19~For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them. 
1 Corinthians~9~20~To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law. 
1 Corinthians~9~21~To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law. 
1 Corinthians~9~22~To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some. 
1 Corinthians~9~23~I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings.
1 Corinthians~9~24~Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. 
1 Corinthians~9~25~Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. 
1 Corinthians~9~26~So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air. 
1 Corinthians~9~27~But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.
1 Corinthians~10~1~For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, 
1 Corinthians~10~2~and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, 
1 Corinthians~10~3~and all ate the same spiritual food, 
1 Corinthians~10~4~and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ. 
1 Corinthians~10~5~Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
1 Corinthians~10~6~Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did. 
1 Corinthians~10~7~Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.” 
1 Corinthians~10~8~We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. 
1 Corinthians~10~9~We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents, 
1 Corinthians~10~10~nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer. 
1 Corinthians~10~11~Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come. 
1 Corinthians~10~12~Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall. 
1 Corinthians~10~13~No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
1 Corinthians~10~14~Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. 
1 Corinthians~10~15~I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. 
1 Corinthians~10~16~The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? 
1 Corinthians~10~17~Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread. 
1 Corinthians~10~18~Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? 
1 Corinthians~10~19~What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? 
1 Corinthians~10~20~No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. 
1 Corinthians~10~21~You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. 
1 Corinthians~10~22~Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
1 Corinthians~10~23~“All things are lawful,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up. 
1 Corinthians~10~24~Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor. 
1 Corinthians~10~25~Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. 
1 Corinthians~10~26~For “the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.” 
1 Corinthians~10~27~If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience. 
1 Corinthians~10~28~But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience— 
1 Corinthians~10~29~I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience? 
1 Corinthians~10~30~If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?
1 Corinthians~10~31~So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. 
1 Corinthians~10~32~Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God, 
1 Corinthians~10~33~just as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.
1 Corinthians~11~1~Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.
1 Corinthians~11~2~Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I delivered them to you. 
1 Corinthians~11~3~But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. 
1 Corinthians~11~4~Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, 
1 Corinthians~11~5~but every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same as if her head were shaven. 
1 Corinthians~11~6~For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. 
1 Corinthians~11~7~For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. 
1 Corinthians~11~8~For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. 
1 Corinthians~11~9~Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. 
1 Corinthians~11~10~That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. 
1 Corinthians~11~11~Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman; 
1 Corinthians~11~12~for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God. 
1 Corinthians~11~13~Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered? 
1 Corinthians~11~14~Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him, 
1 Corinthians~11~15~but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering. 
1 Corinthians~11~16~If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God.
1 Corinthians~11~17~But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse. 
1 Corinthians~11~18~For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, 
1 Corinthians~11~19~for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized. 
1 Corinthians~11~20~When you come together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat. 
1 Corinthians~11~21~For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk. 
1 Corinthians~11~22~What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.
1 Corinthians~11~23~For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, 
1 Corinthians~11~24~and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” 
1 Corinthians~11~25~In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” 
1 Corinthians~11~26~For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
1 Corinthians~11~27~Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. 
1 Corinthians~11~28~Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 
1 Corinthians~11~29~For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. 
1 Corinthians~11~30~That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. 
1 Corinthians~11~31~But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. 
1 Corinthians~11~32~But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.
1 Corinthians~11~33~So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another— 
1 Corinthians~11~34~if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home—so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.
1 Corinthians~12~1~Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. 
1 Corinthians~12~2~You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led. 
1 Corinthians~12~3~Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is accursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit.
1 Corinthians~12~4~Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; 
1 Corinthians~12~5~and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; 
1 Corinthians~12~6~and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone. 
1 Corinthians~12~7~To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. 
1 Corinthians~12~8~For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, 
1 Corinthians~12~9~to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, 
1 Corinthians~12~10~to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. 
1 Corinthians~12~11~All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.
1 Corinthians~12~12~For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. 
1 Corinthians~12~13~For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.
1 Corinthians~12~14~For the body does not consist of one member but of many. 
1 Corinthians~12~15~If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. 
1 Corinthians~12~16~And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. 
1 Corinthians~12~17~If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? 
1 Corinthians~12~18~But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. 
1 Corinthians~12~19~If all were a single member, where would the body be? 
1 Corinthians~12~20~As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.
1 Corinthians~12~21~The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” 
1 Corinthians~12~22~On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, 
1 Corinthians~12~23~and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, 
1 Corinthians~12~24~which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, 
1 Corinthians~12~25~that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. 
1 Corinthians~12~26~If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.
1 Corinthians~12~27~Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. 
1 Corinthians~12~28~And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues. 
1 Corinthians~12~29~Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 
1 Corinthians~12~30~Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 
1 Corinthians~12~31~But earnestly desire the higher gifts.  And I will show you a still more excellent way.
1 Corinthians~13~1~If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 
1 Corinthians~13~2~And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 
1 Corinthians~13~3~If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.
1 Corinthians~13~4~Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant 
1 Corinthians~13~5~or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; 
1 Corinthians~13~6~it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. 
1 Corinthians~13~7~Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
1 Corinthians~13~8~Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. 
1 Corinthians~13~9~For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 
1 Corinthians~13~10~but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. 
1 Corinthians~13~11~When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. 
1 Corinthians~13~12~For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.
1 Corinthians~13~13~So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
1 Corinthians~14~1~Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy. 
1 Corinthians~14~2~For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit. 
1 Corinthians~14~3~On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation. 
1 Corinthians~14~4~The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church. 
1 Corinthians~14~5~Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.
1 Corinthians~14~6~Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? 
1 Corinthians~14~7~If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played? 
1 Corinthians~14~8~And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle? 
1 Corinthians~14~9~So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air. 
1 Corinthians~14~10~There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning, 
1 Corinthians~14~11~but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. 
1 Corinthians~14~12~So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.
1 Corinthians~14~13~Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret. 
1 Corinthians~14~14~For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. 
1 Corinthians~14~15~What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also. 
1 Corinthians~14~16~Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say  “Amen” to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying? 
1 Corinthians~14~17~For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up. 
1 Corinthians~14~18~I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. 
1 Corinthians~14~19~Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
1 Corinthians~14~20~Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature. 
1 Corinthians~14~21~In the Law it is written, “By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.”
1 Corinthians~14~22~Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers. 
1 Corinthians~14~23~If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds? 
1 Corinthians~14~24~But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all, 
1 Corinthians~14~25~the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you.
1 Corinthians~14~26~What then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up. 
1 Corinthians~14~27~If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn, and let someone interpret. 
1 Corinthians~14~28~But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God. 
1 Corinthians~14~29~Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said. 
1 Corinthians~14~30~If a revelation is made to another sitting there, let the first be silent. 
1 Corinthians~14~31~For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged, 
1 Corinthians~14~32~and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. 
1 Corinthians~14~33~For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints, 
1 Corinthians~14~34~the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. 
1 Corinthians~14~35~If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.
1 Corinthians~14~36~Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached? 
1 Corinthians~14~37~If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.
1 Corinthians~14~38~If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized. 
1 Corinthians~14~39~So, my brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. 
1 Corinthians~14~40~But all things should be done decently and in order.
1 Corinthians~15~1~Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, 
1 Corinthians~15~2~and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.
1 Corinthians~15~3~For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, 
1 Corinthians~15~4~that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 
1 Corinthians~15~5~and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. 
1 Corinthians~15~6~Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. 
1 Corinthians~15~7~Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. 
1 Corinthians~15~8~Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. 
1 Corinthians~15~9~For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
1 Corinthians~15~10~But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. 
1 Corinthians~15~11~Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.
1 Corinthians~15~12~Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
1 Corinthians~15~13~But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 
1 Corinthians~15~14~And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. 
1 Corinthians~15~15~We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. 
1 Corinthians~15~16~For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. 
1 Corinthians~15~17~And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. 
1 Corinthians~15~18~Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. 
1 Corinthians~15~19~If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.
1 Corinthians~15~20~But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 
1 Corinthians~15~21~For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. 
1 Corinthians~15~22~For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. 
1 Corinthians~15~23~But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. 
1 Corinthians~15~24~Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. 
1 Corinthians~15~25~For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. 
1 Corinthians~15~26~The last enemy to be destroyed is death. 
1 Corinthians~15~27~For “God has put all things in subjection under his feet.” But when it says, “all things are put in subjection,” it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him. 
1 Corinthians~15~28~When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all.
1 Corinthians~15~29~Otherwise, what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf? 
1 Corinthians~15~30~Why are we in danger every hour? 
1 Corinthians~15~31~I protest, brothers, by my pride in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day! 
1 Corinthians~15~32~What do I gain if, humanly speaking, I fought with beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” 
1 Corinthians~15~33~Do not be deceived: “Bad company ruins good morals.” 
1 Corinthians~15~34~Wake up from your drunken stupor, as is right, and do not go on sinning. For some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.
1 Corinthians~15~35~But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?” 
1 Corinthians~15~36~You foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 
1 Corinthians~15~37~And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain. 
1 Corinthians~15~38~But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body. 
1 Corinthians~15~39~For not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish. 
1 Corinthians~15~40~There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is of one kind, and the glory of the earthly is of another. 
1 Corinthians~15~41~There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
1 Corinthians~15~42~So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable. 
1 Corinthians~15~43~It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. 
1 Corinthians~15~44~It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
1 Corinthians~15~45~Thus it is written, “The first man Adam became a living being”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. 
1 Corinthians~15~46~But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual. 
1 Corinthians~15~47~The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. 
1 Corinthians~15~48~As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. 
1 Corinthians~15~49~Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.
1 Corinthians~15~50~I tell you this, brothers: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. 
1 Corinthians~15~51~Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 
1 Corinthians~15~52~in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed. 
1 Corinthians~15~53~For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. 
1 Corinthians~15~54~When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”
1 Corinthians~15~55~“O death, where is your victory?  O death, where is your sting?”
1 Corinthians~15~56~The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 
1 Corinthians~15~57~But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians~15~58~Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.
1 Corinthians~16~1~Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also are to do. 
1 Corinthians~16~2~On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that there will be no collecting when I come. 
1 Corinthians~16~3~And when I arrive, I will send those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem. 
1 Corinthians~16~4~If it seems advisable that I should go also, they will accompany me.
1 Corinthians~16~5~I will visit you after passing through Macedonia, for I intend to pass through Macedonia, 
1 Corinthians~16~6~and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may help me on my journey, wherever I go. 
1 Corinthians~16~7~For I do not want to see you now just in passing. I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. 
1 Corinthians~16~8~But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, 
1 Corinthians~16~9~for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
1 Corinthians~16~10~When Timothy comes, see that you put him at ease among you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, as I am. 
1 Corinthians~16~11~So let no one despise him. Help him on his way in peace, that he may return to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers.
1 Corinthians~16~12~Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but it was not at all his will to come now. He will come when he has opportunity.
1 Corinthians~16~13~Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. 
1 Corinthians~16~14~Let all that you do be done in love.
1 Corinthians~16~15~Now I urge you, brothers—you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints— 
1 Corinthians~16~16~be subject to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer. 
1 Corinthians~16~17~I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for your absence, 
1 Corinthians~16~18~for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Give recognition to such people.
1 Corinthians~16~19~The churches of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, send you hearty greetings in the Lord. 
1 Corinthians~16~20~All the brothers send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1 Corinthians~16~21~I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. 
1 Corinthians~16~22~If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed. Our Lord, come! 
1 Corinthians~16~23~The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. 24 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2 Corinthians~1~1~Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:
2 Corinthians~1~2~Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Corinthians~1~3~Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, 
2 Corinthians~1~4~who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. 
2 Corinthians~1~5~For as we share abundantly in Christ's sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too. 
2 Corinthians~1~6~If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer. 
2 Corinthians~1~7~Our hope for you is unshaken, for we know that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort.
2 Corinthians~1~8~For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the affliction we experienced in Asia. For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself. 
2 Corinthians~1~9~Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But that was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead. 
2 Corinthians~1~10~He delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again. 
2 Corinthians~1~11~You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many.
2 Corinthians~1~12~For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience, that we behaved in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and supremely so toward you. 
2 Corinthians~1~13~For we are not writing to you anything other than what you read and understand and I hope you will fully understand— 
2 Corinthians~1~14~just as you did partially understand us—that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you.
2 Corinthians~1~15~Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a second experience of grace. 
2 Corinthians~1~16~I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea. 
2 Corinthians~1~17~Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans according to the flesh, ready to say “Yes, yes” and “No, no” at the same time? 
2 Corinthians~1~18~As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No. 
2 Corinthians~1~19~For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not Yes and No, but in him it is always Yes. 
2 Corinthians~1~20~For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory. 
2 Corinthians~1~21~And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, 
2 Corinthians~1~22~and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.
2 Corinthians~1~23~But I call God to witness against me—it was to spare you that I refrained from coming again to Corinth. 
2 Corinthians~1~24~Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith.
2 Corinthians~2~1~For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you. 
2 Corinthians~2~2~For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained? 
2 Corinthians~2~3~And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all. 
2 Corinthians~2~4~For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.
2 Corinthians~2~5~Now if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure—not to put it too severely—to all of you. 
2 Corinthians~2~6~For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough, 
2 Corinthians~2~7~so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. 
2 Corinthians~2~8~So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him. 
2 Corinthians~2~9~For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything. 
2 Corinthians~2~10~Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ, 
2 Corinthians~2~11~so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.
2 Corinthians~2~12~When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord, 
2 Corinthians~2~13~my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia.
2 Corinthians~2~14~But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. 
2 Corinthians~2~15~For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, 
2 Corinthians~2~16~to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? 
2 Corinthians~2~17~For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God's word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.
2 Corinthians~3~1~Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or from you? 
2 Corinthians~3~2~You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, to be known and read by all. 
2 Corinthians~3~3~And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
2 Corinthians~3~4~Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. 
2 Corinthians~3~5~Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God, 
2 Corinthians~3~6~who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
2 Corinthians~3~7~Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses' face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, 
2 Corinthians~3~8~will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory? 
2 Corinthians~3~9~For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory. 
2 Corinthians~3~10~Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it. 
2 Corinthians~3~11~For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory.
2 Corinthians~3~12~Since we have such a hope, we are very bold, 
2 Corinthians~3~13~not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end. 
2 Corinthians~3~14~But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away. 
2 Corinthians~3~15~Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts. 
2 Corinthians~3~16~But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. 
2 Corinthians~3~17~Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 
2 Corinthians~3~18~And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.
2 Corinthians~4~1~Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart. 
2 Corinthians~4~2~But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways. We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God's word, but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God. 
2 Corinthians~4~3~And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. 
2 Corinthians~4~4~In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 
2 Corinthians~4~5~For what we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake. 
2 Corinthians~4~6~For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
2 Corinthians~4~7~But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.
2 Corinthians~4~8~We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; 
2 Corinthians~4~9~persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; 
2 Corinthians~4~10~always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our bodies. 
2 Corinthians~4~11~For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. 
2 Corinthians~4~12~So death is at work in us, but life in you.
2 Corinthians~4~13~Since we have the same spirit of faith according to what has been written, “I believed, and so I spoke,” we also believe, and so we also speak, 
2 Corinthians~4~14~knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. 
2 Corinthians~4~15~For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.
2 Corinthians~4~16~So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. 
2 Corinthians~4~17~For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, 
2 Corinthians~4~18~as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.
2 Corinthians~5~1~For we know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 
2 Corinthians~5~2~For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling, 
2 Corinthians~5~3~if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked. 
2 Corinthians~5~4~For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdened—not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. 
2 Corinthians~5~5~He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.
2 Corinthians~5~6~So we are always of good courage. We know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord, 
2 Corinthians~5~7~for we walk by faith, not by sight. 
2 Corinthians~5~8~Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. 
2 Corinthians~5~9~So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him. 
2 Corinthians~5~10~For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.
2 Corinthians~5~11~Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others. But what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience.
2 Corinthians~5~12~We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart. 
2 Corinthians~5~13~For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. 
2 Corinthians~5~14~For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; 
2 Corinthians~5~15~and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.
2 Corinthians~5~16~From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. 
2 Corinthians~5~17~Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 
2 Corinthians~5~18~All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; 
2 Corinthians~5~19~that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. 
2 Corinthians~5~20~Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. 
2 Corinthians~5~21~For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
2 Corinthians~6~1~Working together with him, then, we appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in vain. 
2 Corinthians~6~2~For he says, “In a favorable time I listened to you, and in a day of salvation I have helped you.” Behold, now is the favorable time; behold, now is the day of salvation. 
2 Corinthians~6~3~We put no obstacle in anyone's way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry,
2 Corinthians~6~4~but as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: by great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, 
2 Corinthians~6~5~beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger;
2 Corinthians~6~6~by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love; 
2 Corinthians~6~7~by truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; 
2 Corinthians~6~8~through honor and dishonor, through slander and praise. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; 
2 Corinthians~6~9~as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and yet not killed; 
2 Corinthians~6~10~as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing everything.
2 Corinthians~6~11~We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians; our heart is wide open. 
2 Corinthians~6~12~You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affections. 
2 Corinthians~6~13~In return (I speak as to children) widen your hearts also.
2 Corinthians~6~14~Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness? 
2 Corinthians~6~15~What accord has Christ with Belial? Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever? 
2 Corinthians~6~16~What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said, “I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
2 Corinthians~6~17~Therefore go out from their midst, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch no unclean thing; then I will welcome you,
2 Corinthians~6~18~and I will be a father to you, and you shall be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty.”
2 Corinthians~7~1~Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.
2 Corinthians~7~2~Make room in your hearts for us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one. 
2 Corinthians~7~3~I do not say this to condemn you, for I said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together. 
2 Corinthians~7~4~I am acting with great boldness toward you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with comfort. In all our affliction, I am overflowing with joy.
2 Corinthians~7~5~For even when we came into Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were afflicted at every turn—fighting without and fear within. 
2 Corinthians~7~6~But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,
2 Corinthians~7~7~and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted by you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced still more. 
2 Corinthians~7~8~For even if I made you grieve with my letter, I do not regret it—though I did regret it, for I see that that letter grieved you, though only for a while. 
2 Corinthians~7~9~As it is, I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you were grieved into repenting. For you felt a godly grief, so that you suffered no loss through us.
2 Corinthians~7~10~For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death. 
2 Corinthians~7~11~For see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you, but also what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! At every point you have proved yourselves innocent in the matter. 
2 Corinthians~7~12~So although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the one who did the wrong, nor for the sake of the one who suffered the wrong, but in order that your earnestness for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God. 
2 Corinthians~7~13~Therefore we are comforted.  And besides our own comfort, we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all. 
2 Corinthians~7~14~For whatever boasts I made to him about you, I was not put to shame. But just as everything we said to you was true, so also our boasting before Titus has proved true. 
2 Corinthians~7~15~And his affection for you is even greater, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling. 
2 Corinthians~7~16~I rejoice, because I have complete confidence in you.
2 Corinthians~8~1~We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia, 
2 Corinthians~8~2~for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part. 
2 Corinthians~8~3~For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, of their own accord, 
2 Corinthians~8~4~begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints— 
2 Corinthians~8~5~and this, not as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us. 
2 Corinthians~8~6~Accordingly, we urged Titus that as he had started, so he should complete among you this act of grace. 
2 Corinthians~8~7~But as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in our love for you—see that you excel in this act of grace also.
2 Corinthians~8~8~I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine. 
2 Corinthians~8~9~For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich. 
2 Corinthians~8~10~And in this matter I give my judgment: this benefits you, who a year ago started not only to do this work but also to desire to do it. 11 So now finish doing it as well, so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it out of what you have. 
2 Corinthians~8~12~For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have. 
2 Corinthians~8~13~For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened, but that as a matter of fairness 
2 Corinthians~8~14~your abundance at the present time should supply their need, so that their abundance may supply your need, that there may be fairness. 
2 Corinthians~8~15~As it is written, “Whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack.”
2 Corinthians~8~16~But thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same earnest care I have for you. 
2 Corinthians~8~17~For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest he is going to you of his own accord. 
2 Corinthians~8~18~With him we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his preaching of the gospel. 
2 Corinthians~8~19~And not only that, but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us as we carry out this act of grace that is being ministered by us, for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will. 
2 Corinthians~8~20~We take this course so that no one should blame us about this generous gift that is being administered by us, 
2 Corinthians~8~21~for we aim at what is honorable not only in the Lord's sight but also in the sight of man. 
2 Corinthians~8~22~And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found earnest in many matters, but who is now more earnest than ever because of his great confidence in you.
2 Corinthians~8~23~As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for your benefit. And as for our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ. 
2 Corinthians~8~24~So give proof before the churches of your love and of our boasting about you to these men.
2 Corinthians~9~1~Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the ministry for the saints, 
2 Corinthians~8~2~for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year. And your zeal has stirred up most of them. 
2 Corinthians~8~3~But I am sending the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be. 
2 Corinthians~8~4~Otherwise, if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready, we would be humiliated—to say nothing of you—for being so confident. 
2 Corinthians~8~5~So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the gift you have promised, so that it may be ready as a willing gift, not as an exaction.
2 Corinthians~8~6~The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. 
2 Corinthians~8~7~Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 
2 Corinthians~8~8~And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work. 
2 Corinthians~8~9~As it is written, “He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever.”
2 Corinthians~8~10~He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness. 
2 Corinthians~8~11~You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God. 
2 Corinthians~8~12~For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God. 
2 Corinthians~8~13~By their approval of this service, they will glorify God because of your submission that comes from your confession of the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others, 
2 Corinthians~8~14~while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God upon you. 
2 Corinthians~8~15~Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!
2 Corinthians~10~1~I, Paul, myself entreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ—I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold toward you when I am away!— 
2 Corinthians~10~2~I beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show boldness with such confidence as I count on showing against some who suspect us of walking according to the flesh. 
2 Corinthians~10~3~For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh.
2 Corinthians~10~4~For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds. 
2 Corinthians~10~5~We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, 
2 Corinthians~10~6~being ready to punish every disobedience, when your obedience is complete.
2 Corinthians~10~7~Look at what is before your eyes. If anyone is confident that he is Christ's, let him remind himself that just as he is Christ's, so also are we. 
2 Corinthians~10~8~For even if I boast a little too much of our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not be ashamed. 
2 Corinthians~10~9~I do not want to appear to be frightening you with my letters. 
2 Corinthians~10~10~For they say, “His letters are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.” 
2 Corinthians~10~11~Let such a person understand that what we say by letter when absent, we do when present. 
2 Corinthians~10~12~Not that we dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who are commending themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another, they are without understanding.
2 Corinthians~10~13~But we will not boast beyond limits, but will boast only with regard to the area of influence God assigned to us, to reach even to you. 
2 Corinthians~10~14~For we are not overextending ourselves, as though we did not reach you. For we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ. 
2 Corinthians~10~15~We do not boast beyond limit in the labors of others. But our hope is that as your faith increases, our area of influence among you may be greatly enlarged, 
2 Corinthians~10~16 so that we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you, without boasting of work already done in another's area of influence. 
2 Corinthians~10~17~“Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.” 
2 Corinthians~10~18~For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.
2 Corinthians~11~1~I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness. Do bear with me! 
2 Corinthians~11~2~For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. 
2 Corinthians~11~3~But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. 
2 Corinthians~11~4~For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough. 
2 Corinthians~11~5~Indeed, I consider that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles. 
2 Corinthians~11~6~Even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not so in knowledge; indeed, in every way we have made this plain to you in all things.
2 Corinthians~11~7~Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached God's gospel to you free of charge? 
2 Corinthians~11~8~I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you. 
2 Corinthians~11~9~And when I was with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need. So I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way. 
2 Corinthians~11~10~As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia. 
2 Corinthians~11~11~And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!
2 Corinthians~11~12~And what I am doing I will continue to do, in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do. 
2 Corinthians~11~13~For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 
2 Corinthians~11~14~And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 
2 Corinthians~11~15~So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.
2 Corinthians~11~16~I repeat, let no one think me foolish. But even if you do, accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little. 
2 Corinthians~11~17~What I am saying with this boastful confidence, I say not as the Lord would but as a fool. 
2 Corinthians~11~18~Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast. 19 For you gladly bear with fools, being wise yourselves! 
2 Corinthians~11~20~For you bear it if someone makes slaves of you, or devours you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or strikes you in the face. 
2 Corinthians~11~21~To my shame, I must say, we were too weak for that! But whatever anyone else dares to boast of—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast of that. 
2 Corinthians~11~22~Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they offspring of Abraham? So am I. 
2 Corinthians~11~23~Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one—I am talking like a madman—with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death. 
2 Corinthians~11~24~Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. 
2 Corinthians~11~25~Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea; 
2 Corinthians~11~26~on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers; 
2 Corinthians~11~27~in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. 
2 Corinthians~11~28~And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches. 
2 Corinthians~11~29~Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant?
2 Corinthians~11~30~If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. 
2 Corinthians~11~31~The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying. 
2 Corinthians~11~32~At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to seize me, 
2 Corinthians~11~33~but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.
2 Corinthians~12~1~I must go on boasting. Though there is nothing to be gained by it, I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
2 Corinthians~12~2~I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows. 
2 Corinthians~12~3~And I know that this man was caught up into paradise—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows— 
2 Corinthians~12~4~and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter. 
2 Corinthians~12~5~On behalf of this man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses— 
2 Corinthians~12~6~though if I should wish to boast, I would not be a fool, for I would be speaking the truth; but I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me. 
2 Corinthians~12~7~So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited. 
2 Corinthians~12~8~Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. 
2 Corinthians~12~9~But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 
2 Corinthians~12~10~For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
2 Corinthians~12~11~I have been a fool! You forced me to it, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I was not at all inferior to these super-apostles, even though I am nothing. 
2 Corinthians~12~12~The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience, with signs and wonders and mighty works. 
2 Corinthians~12~13~For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!
2 Corinthians~12~14~Here for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be a burden, for I seek not what is yours but you. For children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. 
2 Corinthians~12~15~I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less? 
2 Corinthians~12~16~But granting that I myself did not burden you, I was crafty, you say, and got the better of you by deceit. 
2 Corinthians~12~17~Did I take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you? 
2 Corinthians~12~18~I urged Titus to go, and sent the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not act in the same spirit? Did we not take the same steps?
2 Corinthians~12~19~Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? It is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ, and all for your upbuilding, beloved. 
2 Corinthians~12~20~For I fear that perhaps when I come I may find you not as I wish, and that you may find me not as you wish—that perhaps there may be quarreling, jealousy, anger, hostility, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder. 
2 Corinthians~12~21~I fear that when I come again my God may humble me before you, and I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and sensuality that they have practiced.
2 Corinthians~13~1~This is the third time I am coming to you. Every charge must be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. 
2 Corinthians~13~2~I warned those who sinned before and all the others, and I warn them now while absent, as I did when present on my second visit, that if I come again I will not spare them— 
2 Corinthians~13~3~since you seek proof that Christ is speaking in me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you. 
2 Corinthians~13~4~For he was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but in dealing with you we will live with him by the power of God.
2 Corinthians~13~5~Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you fail to meet the test! 
2 Corinthians~13~6~I hope you will find out that we have not failed the test. 
2 Corinthians~13~7~But we pray to God that you may not do wrong—not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, though we may seem to have failed. 
2 Corinthians~13~8~For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth. 
2 Corinthians~13~9~For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. Your restoration is what we pray for. 
2 Corinthians~13~10~For this reason I write these things while I am away from you, that when I come I may not have to be severe in my use of the authority that the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down.
2 Corinthians~13~11~Finally, brothers, rejoice. Aim for restoration, comfort one another, agree with one another, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you. 
2 Corinthians~13~12~Greet one another with a holy kiss. 13 All the saints greet you.
2 Corinthians~13~14~The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
1 John~1~1~That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life— 
1 John~1~2~the life was made manifest, and we have seen it, and testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was made manifest to us— 
1 John~1~3~that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 
1 John~1~4~And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.
1 John~1~5~This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. 
1 John~1~6~If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. 
1 John~1~7~But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. 
1 John~1~8~If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 
1 John~1~9~If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 
1 John~1~10~If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
1 John~2~1~My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. 
1 John~2~2~He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. 
1 John~2~3~And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. 
1 John~2~4~Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, 
1 John~2~5~but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may know that we are in him:
1 John~2~6~whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.
1 John~2~7~Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard. 
1 John~2~8~At the same time, it is a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. 
1 John~2~9~Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness. 
1 John~2~10~Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. 
1 John~2~11~But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
1 John~2~12~I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his name's sake.
1 John~2~13~I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.  I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.  I write to you, children, because you know the Father.
1 John~2~14~I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.  I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
1 John~2~15~Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
1 John~2~16~For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. 
1 John~2~17~And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.
1 John~2~18~Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour. 
1 John~2~19~They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us. 
1 John~2~20~But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and you all have knowledge.
1 John~2~21~I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth. 
1 John~2~22~Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. 
1 John~2~23~No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also. 
1 John~2~24~Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father. 
1 John~2~25~And this is the promise that he made to us—eternal life.
1 John~2~26~I write these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you. 
1 John~2~27~But the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie—just as it has taught you, abide in him.
1 John~2~28~And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming. 
1 John~2~29~If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.
1 John~3~1~See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. 
1 John~3~2~Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. 
1 John~3~3~And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.
1 John~3~4~Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. 
1 John~3~5~You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.
1 John~3~6~No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. 
1 John~3~7~Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. 
1 John~3~8~Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. 
1 John~3~9~No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. 
1 John~3~10	By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.
1 John~3~11~For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. 
1 John~3~12~We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous. 
1 John~3~13~Do not be surprised, brothers, that the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death. 
1 John~3~15~Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
1 John~3~16~By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. 
1 John~3~17~But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him? 
1 John~3~18~Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.
1 John~3~19~By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him; 
1 John~3~20~for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything. 
1 John~3~21~Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; 
1 John~3~22~and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. 
1 John~3~23~And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. 
1 John~3~24~Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God, and God in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us.
1 John~4~1~Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 
1 John~4~2~By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 
1 John~4~3~and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already. 
1 John~4~4~Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. 
1 John~4~5~They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them. 
1 John~4~6~We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
1 John~4~7~Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. 
1 John~4~8~Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 
1 John~4~9~In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. 
1 John~4~10	In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 
1 John~4~11~Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 
1 John~4~12~No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.
1 John~4~13~By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. 
1 John~4~14~And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 
1 John~4~15~Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 
1 John~4~16~So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. 
1 John~4~17~By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world. 
1 John~4~18~There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love. 
1 John~4~19~We love because he first loved us. 
1 John~4~20~If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. 
1 John~4~21~And this commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother.
1 John~5~1~Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him. 
1 John~5~2~By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. 
1 John~5~3~For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome. 
1 John~5~4~For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. 
1 John~5~5~Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
1 John~5~6~This is he who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ; not by the water only but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 
1 John~5~7~For there are three that testify: 
1 John~5~8~the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree. 
1 John~5~9~If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son. 
1 John~5~10	Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son. 
1 John~5~11~And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 
1 John~5~12~Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
1 John~5~13~I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life. 
1 John~5~14~And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. 
1 John~5~15~And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him.
1 John~5~16~If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life—to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. There is sin that leads to death; I do not say that one should pray for that. 
1 John~5~17~All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.
1 John~5~18~We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.
1 John~5~19~We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
1 John~5~20~And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 
1 John~5~21~Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
2 John~1~1~The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who know the truth, 
2 John~1~2~because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:
2 John~1~3~Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love.
2 John~1~4~I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father. 
2 John~1~5~And now I ask you, dear lady—not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another. 
2 John~1~6~And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it. 
2 John~1~7~For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. 
2 John~1~8~Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward. 
2 John~1~9~Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. 
2 John~1~10~If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting, 
2 John~1~11~for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works.
2 John~1~12~Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
2 John~1~13~The children of your elect sister greet you.
3 John~1~1~The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.
3 John~1~2~Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, as it goes well with your soul. 
3 John~1~3~For I rejoiced greatly when the brothers came and testified to your truth, as indeed you are walking in the truth. 
3 John~1~4~I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
3 John~1~5~Beloved, it is a faithful thing you do in all your efforts for these brothers, strangers as they are, 
3 John~1~6~who testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their journey in a manner worthy of God. 
3 John~1~7~For they have gone out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles. 
3 John~1~8~Therefore we ought to support people like these, that we may be fellow workers for the truth.
3 John~1~9~I have written something to the church, but Diotrephes, who likes to put himself first, does not acknowledge our authority. 
3 John~1~10~So if I come, I will bring up what he is doing, talking wicked nonsense against us. And not content with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers, and also stops those who want to and puts them out of the church.
3 John~1~11~Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God. 
3 John~1~12~Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself. We also add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.
3 John~1~13~I had much to write to you, but I would rather not write with pen and ink. 
3 John~1~14~I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face.
3 John~1~15~Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends, each by name.
Jude~1~1~Jude a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, To those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ:
Jude~1~2~May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.
Jude~1~3~Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints. 
Jude~1~4~For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
Jude~1~5~Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. 
Jude~1~6~And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day— 
Jude~1~7~just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.
Jude~1~8~Yet in like manner these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the glorious ones. 
Jude~1~9~But when the archangel Michael, contending with the devil, was disputing about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, “The Lord rebuke you.” 
Jude~1~10~But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand, and they are destroyed by all that they, like unreasoning animals, understand instinctively. 
Jude~1~11~Woe to them! For they walked in the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam's error and perished in Korah's rebellion. 
Jude~1~12~These are hidden reefs at your love feasts, as they feast with you without fear, shepherds feeding themselves; waterless clouds, swept along by winds; fruitless trees in late autumn, twice dead, uprooted; 
Jude~1~13~wild waves of the sea, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever.
Jude~1~14~It was also about these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, “Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones, 
Jude~1~15~to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.” 
Jude~1~16~These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own sinful desires; they are loud-mouthed boasters, showing favoritism to gain advantage.
Jude~1~17~But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Jude~1~18~They said to you, “In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.” 
Jude~1~19~It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit. 
Jude~1~20~But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, 
Jude~1~21~keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. 
Jude~1~22~And have mercy on those who doubt; 
Jude~1~23~save others by snatching them out of the fire; to others show mercy with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh.
Jude~1~24~Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy, 
Jude~1~25~to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.
